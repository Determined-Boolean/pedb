This is currently just tossed together and not well formed. I plan on updating it when I get some time to put into writing it correctly. 

Right now to get it to run just fix the variables below and execute the script.

  * sqldb = 'test.db' #database name
  * walk_dir = "C:\\test\\" # directory of files
